                        <h3>PREVAILING ECONOMY</h3>
                        <p>
                            The year 2016 presented a lot of challenges; as the Nigerian economy officially plunged into
                            recession after the GDP contracted in three consecutive quarters. The two major factors
                            responsible were the low oil prices which reduced foreign exchange earnings and the
                            resurgence of Niger Delta militancy which disrupted crude oil production in the delta
                            region.
                            In addition, the impact of the foreign exchange policies of the Central Bank of Nigeria
                            dominated the year. The liberalization of the foreign exchange market in June, resulted in
                            45% devaluation of the Naira from 197 to 285. The premium between the official and parallel
                            market rates widened with the official rate closing at 305 in December 2016, as headline
                            inflation maintained an upward trend opening the year in January 2016 at 9.6% and closing in
                            December 2016 at 18.6%.
                            All these resulted in higher operational costs, increase in general cost of living and
                            reduction in disposable income of Nigerians. The year 2016 I would say, was a fall out of
                            the downward turn of the Nigerian economy, as it was in recession in the year under review;
                            of which the information is based on the GDP parameters received from different quarters.
                            Global Oil Price crash causing reduction in foreign exchange earnings played a major role in
                            the downward turn of the economy coupled with the insurgency of militant groups disrupting
                            oil production thereby making oil output fall to an all-time low. Inflation closing at 18.6%
                            had a negative impact on Airopay, increasing operational costs.

                        <h3 class="text-center">FINANCIAL SUMMARY</h3>
                        <h3>Capital structure</h3>
                        <p>
                            Total shareholders fund of Airopay has been negative with a report of -6,167,459 in 2016,
                            -12,418,894 in 2017 and finally -11,615,719. This negative effect prevailed as a result of
                            the negative profit after tax; stemming from high operational expenses; which consistently
                            led to a decline in general reserve over the years. Total share capital remained 20,000,000
                            in 2017 and 2018; comprising of 20 million shares issued at N1 each.
                            The long-term assets (fixed assets and investments) of Airopay stood at N7.6 million in 2018
                            from N8.3 million in 2017 and 9 million in 2016; representing a decline of 8.4%. The CAGR
                            between 2016 and 2018 stood at -5%. The Long-term assets consist majorly of Property, Plant
                            and Equipment; as well as intangible assets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The current assets which declined to N5.51mn in 2018 from N10.88mn in 2017 and 42.90mn in
                            2016 was aggravated by a drastic decline in receivables over this period. Receivables fell
                            from N42.87 million to N10.87 million and, finally to N3.55 million in 2018. There was a
                            growth in cash & bank balances as well as an introduction of cash held in foreign currency
                            at N1.69million. Adding the long-term assets and the current assets of the company together,
                            the total assets declined by 63% in 2017 and 32% in 2018. This represents a CAGR of -37%
                            between 2016 and 2018.
                            The total assets of the company were financed by a mix of equity trade payables and amount
                            owed to related companies. As at December 2018, the total Assets of Airopay stood at N13.11
                            million while total liabilities stood at N26.29 million. It had no long-term borrowings, but
                            its liability was 201% of total assets; given a negative equity of -11.62 million.
                            Over the years, the operating expenses have been increasing, and exceeding the gross profit,
                            which has been driving a negative operating income; except in 2018. This therefore has led
                            to a negative bottom-line over time.
                            We recommend a review of the operating expenses, especially the controllable ones in order
                            to reduce pressure on the earnings attributable to the Ordinary Shareholders.
                            Working capital stood at N3.94mn at the end of the year 2018, a reduction from N6.55mn as at
                            the end of the previous year, and 23.56mn in the year before. In addition, the current ratio
                            and the quick ratio as at 2018 stood at 3.51x and 3.51x respectively, an increase from 2.51x
                            and 2.5x, respectively from 2017. This should be compared with the industry average. Airopay
                            should however, monitor the excess liquidity to enable more efficient use of funds.
                            Meanwhile, the capital employed (i.e. total assets less current liabilities) decreased from
                            N32,561,406 in 2016 to 11,539,252 in 2018, a CAGR of -29%.
                        </p>
                        <h3>LIQUIDITY</h3>
                        <p>
                            The current asset of the company decreased from 42,891,406 in 2016, to 5,509,252 in 2018,
                            indicating a CAGR of -50%. The major contributors to the decrease over the three years are
                            receivables as well as cash and cash equivalents with a CAGR of -56% and 3.51% respectively.
                            Trade debtors reduced substantially between 2016 and 2017, which signifies a drastic fall in
                            revenue, which reduced from N1,103,689,489 in 2016 to N38,939,000 in 2017 and finally
                            N135,225,132 in 2018. In another development, the current liabilities between 2016 and 2018
                            has
                            experienced a CAGR of -57%. The relationship between current assets and current liabilities
                            is
                            evident, as depicted by the working capital CAGR of -45%. In addition, the current ratio and
                            quick ratios have shown an improvement over the years.
                            The cash flow from investing activities stood at zero all through the three years meaning
                            there
                            was neither investment nor sale in tangible and intangible assets. Cash flow from financing
                            stood at N4,112,228 in 2018, after experiencing a negative balance of N-11,461,668 in 2017,
                            and
                            an all-time high of N58,728,865 in 2016. For operating activities, Airopay experienced
                            negative
                            cash flow in 2016 (N-58,707,459) and positive cash flows in 2017 (N11,448,565) and 2018
                            (N6,063,176) respectively.
                        </p>
                        <h3>PROFITABILITY</h3>
                        <p>
                            Airopay recorded drastic fluctuations in its top line during the last 3 years as revenue
                            declined from N1,103,689,489 in 2016, to N38,939,000 in 2017; and then increased to
                            N135,225,132
                            in 2018 this, indicating a CAGR of -50%.
                            In line with this, the growth in the bottom-line is not as consistent. Profit after tax
                            increased from N-26,167,459 in 2016, to N803,176 in 2018; which poses an improvement, and
                            which
                            also signals better control of operating expenses.
                            Similarly, the return on assets stood at 4.98% in 2018, which is an improvement from -17.6%
                            in
                            2017 and -50.4% in 2016. An upward trend is also observed in operating return on assets. The
                            performance is impressive and depicts a fair cost and asset management strategy. Also,
                            operating
                            profit margin began at -2.4% in 2016, and finally stood at 0.59% in 2018
                        </p>
                        <h3>MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY</h3>
                        <p>
                            Receivables turnover has experienced fluctuations over the years, between 25.7x and 0.364x,
                            which is not surprising; giving the trend in sales. Although, there is an improvement in
                            2018,
                            of which receivables turnover increased from 0.36x to 4.69x. It has also experienced
                            fluctuating
                            working capital turnover, which should be compared with industry norms. Measures should be
                            taken
                            to ensure that the company will be able to sufficiently sustain itself and sufficiently
                            finance
                            its operations in future.</p>

                            INVESTMENT ANALYSIS</h3>
                        <p>
                            An investment in Airopay’s shares in the past two years has not proved to be a worthwhile
                            investment in terms of shareholders’ funds, which has shown a consistently negative figure
                            from
                            N-6,167,459 to N-11,615,179 in 2018; showing a CAGR of 23%. Although the total outstanding
                            share
                            capital stood at N20,000,000, its earnings per share has fluctuated over time, reaching its
                            peak
                            in 2018, at 0.08 Naira. There was a negative EPS in 2016 at -2.62 Naira and in 2017 at -0.63
                            Naira. No dividend has been returned to shareholders over this period
